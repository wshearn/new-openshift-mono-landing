	        For these steps I am going to assume you already have MonoDevelop 4 and
	        Git installed and working.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    	The following is the quick getting started steps.
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Start up Monodevelop 4</li>
	    		<li>Click in the menu bar "Version Control->Checkout"</li>
	    		<li>It will open a dialog box. In the dropdown choose git. It should look like
	    			<a href="/Images/GettingStarted/monodevelop-git.png">this</a></li>
	    		<li>Paste "@ViewBag.GitURL" into the URL box.</li>
	    		<li>Change "Target Directory" to a new directory where you want your code to be stored.(I used /home/&lt;username&gt;/Projects/mono</li>
	    		<li>Click on OK</li>
	    		<li>Once it has finished click on "File->Open"</li>
	    		<li>And navigate to where you checked out the code and choose the OpenShift.csproj</li>
	    		<li>Build the project "Build->Build All"</li>
	    	</ul>
	    </p>

	    <p> <!-- WALL OF TEXT I need to do something about this -->
	        From there to push your changes to your site click on "Version Control->Commit Solution" add a
	        commit message and check the box labeled "Push changes to remote repository after commit" and press commit.
	        On the dialog box that comes up after that press "Push Changes". When the status box at the top middle of
	        MonoDevelop says "Push operation successfully completed." you are done. Be warned the first time you access
	        your page after you make a push mono takes a bit to start up, don't worry if your browser sits there waiting
	        it will come up. Congratulations and happy hacking.
	    </p>
